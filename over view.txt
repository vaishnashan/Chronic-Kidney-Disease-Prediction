Chronic Kidney Disease dataset
Data has 25 feattures which may predict a patient with chronic kidney disease

The data was taken over a 2-month period in India with 25 features
( eg, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, etc). 
The target is the 'classification', which is either 'ckd' or 'notckd' -
 ckd=chronic kidney disease. There are 400 rows

The data needs cleaning: in that it has NaNs and the numeric features need to be forced to floats
 Basically, we were instructed to get rid of ALL ROWS with Nans,
  with no threshold - meaning, any row that has even one NaN, gets deleted.

Part 1: We are asked to choose 3 features (bgr, rc, wc), 
visualize them, then run the PCA with n_components=2.
the PCA is to be run twice: one with no scaling and the second run WITH scaling.
 And this is where my issue starts â€¦ in that after scaling I can hardly see any difference!
